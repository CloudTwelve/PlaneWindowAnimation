# PlaneWindowAnimation
This is an animation of three plane windows. When hovering on the body, the entire plane scene changes to nighttime, the cabin taking on a darker shade of grey and the sky behind the clouds turning to midnight blue.

# Contents
This was created using an HTML file and a CSS file, using GitHub and VSCode (as well as Apple's Terminal to push changes). At one point, this included a JS file, but I learned CSS could do what I used JS for, so woohoo and alhamdulillah (thank God) for that!
